A calm, consent-based platform for asking for and offering help in the community — without pressure, rage, or performance.

## Problem Statement

**What is the problem?**
People want to ask for and offer help within their community, but existing tools create social friction — performance anxiety, pressure dynamics, and lack of consent-based interactions make this harder than it needs to be.

**Who is affected?**
Members of the community interested in a sharing economy.

**What exists today?**
Various buy-nothing groups, community Facebook groups, and mutual aid networks exist, but they tend to be informal, high-friction, and lack structure for consent-based matching.

**Why now?**
As climate change affects our food systems and personal security, community resilience depends on thinking in terms of collective wellbeing rather than individual success. We need infrastructure that makes it easy to give and receive help.

## Solution Overview

A platform for people to post asks and offers, matched with others in their community — built on calm, consent-based principles.
